picloq
======

An Android application which displays a picture for each hour of the day

Description
======

picloq (lower case, intentionally) is an application which associates a photo with each hour of the day.  For example,
if the user chooses to associate 1pm with a photo of their cat, from 1pm to 1:59pm the app will show that image with the
time overlaid

Motiviation
======

I'm mostly writing this app for fun and practice while I wait for parts to arrive so I can continue working on another pet
project, [LionEyes](https://github.com/bradsk88/LionEyes).  This natural state for this app seems to be a widget, rather
than an actual "app" and will be my first widget.

Schedule
======

-Branding
